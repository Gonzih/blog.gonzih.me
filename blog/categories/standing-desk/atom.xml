I feel myself much more productive behind standing desk.
But commercial desks suffer from high price and complicated design.</p>

<p>Solution? Build your own standing desk!</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I started using standing desk by making small stand on top of my ordinary desk, so I can remove it when I'm to lazy to stand. It was one year ago.
After a while with that solution I decided to build my proper standing desk.
But how and what to use as materials? Plain wood is too heavy, expensive and build will take more time (if you want a nice looking desk).
And then I saw joints and pipes used in furniture.
I took unused small door from my desk, some metal pipes (25mm in diameter) and joints.
And best thing is that height is adjustable.
You can build it with 2 shelfs and make bottom one wider for keyboard and mouse and put display on the top shelf.
Easy to put together and take a part. Nice looking.
Cheap. Total cost of materials was ~35$.
For nice and clean cuts some old pipe cutter is perfect.</p>
