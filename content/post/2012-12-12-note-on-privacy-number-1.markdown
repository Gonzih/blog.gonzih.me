Today I removed from my blog all stuff that can track users. I removed Twitter follow and tweet buttons, Google +1 button, Google Analytics script, Facebook related crap.

Why? Because it's just unfair. Why would you provide any information about yourself by just being curious? I actually not interested in how many people are reading my blog, anything about traffic sources. Only thing that I am interested in is feedback from users. That is why I left Disqus unchanged. Maybe later I will find something more open and replace Disqus with it. But for now if privacy is issue for you check out [Ghostery exstension for Google Chrome (Chromium)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij).
