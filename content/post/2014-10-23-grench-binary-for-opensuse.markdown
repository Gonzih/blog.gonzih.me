[Grenchman](https://leiningen.org/grench.html) is a small tool that runs leiningen tasks over nrepl.

Helps with JVM startup time during development.
Build in OCaml. If you are not in to the building binary on your own,
there are pre-build binaries on the [official website](https://leiningen.org/grench.html).

And here is one missing binary for OpenSUSE (tested on 13.1, fedora binary does not work).
