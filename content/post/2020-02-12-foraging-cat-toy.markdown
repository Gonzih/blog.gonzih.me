Here is a small foraging cat toy based on design I saw in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su1XqO96X2Y).

Main difference in my design is that its implemented in OpenSCAD and is also configurable.

Preview of design is available on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4159282) or [github](https://github.com/Gonzih/scad-library/blob/master/stl/foraging_cat_toy_preview.stl).

OpenSCAD source code is available also on [github](https://github.com/Gonzih/scad-library/blob/master/foraging_cat_toy.scad).
