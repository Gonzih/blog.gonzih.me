Here is a foraging cat toy based on design I saw in [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su1XqO96X2Y) by [EvanAndKatelyn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuMYw2l2UeWyTGYixYfRCA).

Main difference in this design is that it's implemented in OpenSCAD and as a result is fully configurable.

3D designs are available on [github](https://github.com/Gonzih/scad-library/blob/master/stl/foraging_cat_toy.stl).
OpenSCAD source code is available also on [github](https://github.com/Gonzih/scad-library/blob/master/foraging_cat_toy.scad),
which can be used to customize this design.
