Recently I was playing with Clojure on Beaglebone and decided to give a try to Oracle's new Embedded JRE.
But after downloading JRE from Oracle website (with filling useless stupid forms) I received following error:
```text
java: no such file or directory
```
So here is fix:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y libc6-armel libsfgcc1
```
